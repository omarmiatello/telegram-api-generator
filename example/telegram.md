## Getting updates

### Data Types

<p>This <a href="#available-types">object</a> represents an incoming update.<br>At most <strong>one</strong> of the optional parameters can be present in any given update.</p>

    Update(update_id: Integer, message: Message, edited_message: Message, channel_post: Message, edited_channel_post: Message, inline_query: InlineQuery, chosen_inline_result: ChosenInlineResult, callback_query: CallbackQuery, shipping_query: ShippingQuery, pre_checkout_query: PreCheckoutQuery, poll: Poll, poll_answer: PollAnswer, my_chat_member: ChatMemberUpdated, chat_member: ChatMemberUpdated)

<p>Contains information about the current status of a webhook.</p>

    WebhookInfo(url: String, has_custom_certificate: Boolean, pending_update_count: Integer, ip_address: String, last_error_date: Integer, last_error_message: String, max_connections: Integer, allowed_updates: List<String>)

### Methods

<p>Use this method to receive incoming updates using long polling (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling">wiki</a>). An Array of <a href="#update">Update</a> objects is returned.</p><blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Notes</strong><br><strong>1.</strong> This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up.<br><strong>2.</strong> In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate <em>offset</em> after each server response.</p> 
</blockquote>

    getUpdates(offset: Integer, limit: Integer, timeout: Integer, allowed_updates: List<String>)

<p>Use this method to specify a url and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified url, containing a JSON-serialized <a href="#update">Update</a>. In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns <em>True</em> on success.</p><p>If you'd like to make sure that the Webhook request comes from Telegram, we recommend using a secret path in the URL, e.g. <code>https://www.example.com/&lt;token&gt;</code>. Since nobody else knows your bot's token, you can be pretty sure it's us.</p><blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Notes</strong><br><strong>1.</strong> You will not be able to receive updates using <a href="#getupdates">getUpdates</a> for as long as an outgoing webhook is set up.<br><strong>2.</strong> To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your <a href="/bots/self-signed">public key certificate</a> using <em>certificate</em> parameter. Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work.<br><strong>3.</strong> Ports currently supported <em>for Webhooks</em>: <strong>443, 80, 88, 8443</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>NEW!</strong> If you're having any trouble setting up webhooks, please check out this <a href="/bots/webhooks">amazing guide to Webhooks</a>.</p> 
</blockquote>

    setWebhook(url: String, certificate: InputFile, ip_address: String, max_connections: Integer, allowed_updates: List<String>, drop_pending_updates: Boolean)

<p>Use this method to remove webhook integration if you decide to switch back to <a href="#getupdates">getUpdates</a>. Returns <em>True</em> on success.</p>

    deleteWebhook(drop_pending_updates: Boolean)

<p>Use this method to get current webhook status. Requires no parameters. On success, returns a <a href="#webhookinfo">WebhookInfo</a> object. If the bot is using <a href="#getupdates">getUpdates</a>, will return an object with the <em>url</em> field empty.</p>

<p>This object represents a <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#keyboards">custom keyboard</a> with reply options (see <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#keyboards">Introduction to bots</a> for details and examples).</p>

    ReplyKeyboardMarkup(keyboard: List<List<KeyboardButton>>, resize_keyboard: Boolean, one_time_keyboard: Boolean, selective: Boolean)

<p>This object represents one button of the reply keyboard. For simple text buttons <em>String</em> can be used instead of this object to specify text of the button. Optional fields <em>request_contact</em>, <em>request_location</em>, and <em>request_poll</em> are mutually exclusive.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>request_contact</em> and <em>request_location</em> options will only work in Telegram versions released after 9 April, 2016. Older clients will display <em>unsupported message</em>.<br><strong>Note:</strong> <em>request_poll</em> option will only work in Telegram versions released after 23 January, 2020.

<p>This object represents type of a poll, which is allowed to be created and sent when the corresponding button is pressed.</p>

    KeyboardButtonPollType(type: String)

<p>Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will remove the current custom keyboard and display the default letter-keyboard. By default, custom keyboards are displayed until a new keyboard is sent by a bot. An exception is made for one-time keyboards that are hidden immediately after the user presses a button (see <a href="#replykeyboardmarkup">ReplyKeyboardMarkup</a>).</p>

    ReplyKeyboardRemove(remove_keyboard: Boolean, selective: Boolean)

<p>This object represents an <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#inline-keyboards-and-on-the-fly-updating">inline keyboard</a> that appears right next to the message it belongs to.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This will only work in Telegram versions released after 9 April, 2016. Older clients will display <em>unsupported message</em>.</p>

    InlineKeyboardMarkup(inline_keyboard: List<List<InlineKeyboardButton>>)

<p>This object represents one button of an inline keyboard. You <strong>must</strong> use exactly one of the optional fields.</p>

    InlineKeyboardButton(text: String, url: String, login_url: LoginUrl, callback_data: String, switch_inline_query: String, switch_inline_query_current_chat: String, callback_game: CallbackGame, pay: Boolean)

<p>This object represents a parameter of the inline keyboard button used to automatically authorize a user. Serves as a great replacement for the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login">Telegram Login Widget</a> when the user is coming from Telegram. All the user needs to do is tap/click a button and confirm that they want to log in:</p><p>Telegram apps support these buttons as of <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots#meet-seamless-web-bots">version 5.7</a>.</p><blockquote> 
 <p>Sample bot: <a href="https://t.me/discussbot">@discussbot</a></p> 
</blockquote>

    LoginUrl(url: String, forward_text: String, bot_username: String, request_write_access: Boolean)

<p>This object represents an incoming callback query from a callback button in an <a href="/bots#inline-keyboards-and-on-the-fly-updating">inline keyboard</a>. If the button that originated the query was attached to a message sent by the bot, the field <em>message</em> will be present. If the button was attached to a message sent via the bot (in <a href="#inline-mode">inline mode</a>), the field <em>inline_message_id</em> will be present. Exactly one of the fields <em>data</em> or <em>game_short_name</em> will be present.</p><blockquote> 
 <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> After the user presses a callback button, Telegram clients will display a progress bar until you call <a href="#answercallbackquery">answerCallbackQuery</a>. It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling <a href="#answercallbackquery">answerCallbackQuery</a> even if no notification to the user is needed (e.g., without specifying any of the optional parameters).</p> 
</blockquote>

    CallbackQuery(id: String, from: User, message: Message, inline_message_id: String, chat_instance: String, data: String, game_short_name: String)

<p>Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice <a href="/bots#privacy-mode">privacy mode</a>.</p><blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Example:</strong> A <a href="https://t.me/PollBot">poll bot</a> for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.</li> 
  <li>Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use <a href="#forcereply">ForceReply</a> in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions — without any extra work for the user.</p> 
</blockquote>

<p>Use this method when you need to tell the user that something is happening on the bot's side. The status is set for 5 seconds or less (when a message arrives from your bot, Telegram clients clear its typing status). Returns <em>True</em> on success.</p><blockquote> 
 <p>Example: The <a href="https://t.me/imagebot">ImageBot</a> needs some time to process a request and upload the image. Instead of sending a text message along the lines of “Retrieving image, please wait…”, the bot may use <a href="#sendchataction">sendChatAction</a> with <em>action</em> = <em>upload_photo</em>. The user will see a “sending photo” status for the bot.</p> 
</blockquote><p>We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a <strong>noticeable</strong> amount of time to arrive.</p>

It is guaranteed that the link will be valid for at least 1 hour. When the link expires, a new one can be requested by calling <a href="#getfile">getFile</a> again.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This function may not preserve the original file name and MIME type. You should save the file's MIME type and name (if available) when the File object is received.</p>

    getFile(file_id: String)

<p>Use this method to kick a user from a group, a supergroup or a channel. In the case of supergroups and channels, the user will not be able to return to the chat on their own using invite links, etc., unless <a href="#unbanchatmember">unbanned</a> first.
